* 🧠 **LLM-Powered Recommendations** – Uses a local language model (LLaMA2 via Ollama) to generate intelligent, goal-aligned plans.
* 🧾 **Meal Plan History** – Automatically stores your past meal plans locally so you can revisit them anytime.
* 🥗 **Ingredient-Based Recipe Suggestions** – Enter ingredients you already have to get a healthy recipe instantly.

## 🛠️ In Progress

Here’s what we’re actively working on:

* 📤 **Export to PDF** – One-click PDF downloads of recipes and meal plans, including grocery lists and checkboxes.
* 🧠 **Smarter Prompts & Better Output Formatting** – Making the LLM outputs cleaner and easier to read (e.g., no fluff text).
* 📅 **Tab-Based UI** – Navigating between "Meal Planner", "Meal History", and "Recipe Generator" is now more intuitive.

## 🚀 Coming Soon

Planned features for the near future:

* 📲 **Automated Meal Notifications** – Daily personalized meal plans delivered to your inbox or via a mobile app notification.
* 🧩 **Regeneration & Customization** – Don’t like a meal plan? Request edits, swap out meals, or regenerate with custom notes.
